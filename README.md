# FairSplit - Bill Payment Tracker

**FairSplit** is a simple app built as part of my practice with React. It allows users to track the payment status of a shared bill, determining who has paid, how much they've paid, and who still needs to contribute. This app helps in splitting expenses between friends or group members in a fair way.

## Key Features

- Input the total bill value and track how much each person has contributed.
- Automatically calculates how much each person owes or is owed based on their contributions.
- Provides a clear view of who needs to pay and who has already paid.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Used for building the user interface and managing the app's components.
- **useState**: A React Hook used to manage the state within the app.
- **Context API**: Used for managing global state across the app without the need to prop-drill.

## App Workflow

1. **Enter the total bill amount**.
2. **Record your contribution**.
3. **Track the remaining amount** that your friend owes or has paid.
4. **View the final breakdown** of who owes what.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
